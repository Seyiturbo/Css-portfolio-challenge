# Css portfolio challenge.
## Introduction.
This readme serves as the documentation for my evolving portfolio page, intended to be continually updated as my course advances. The portfolio is designed to present a comprehensive overview of my skills and talents for prospective employers.It aims to showcase my most impactful work and provide insight into the strategic thinking behind each project.


## Actions performed to reach the challenge file.
I made a new repository called 'responsive-portfolio-website' on my GitHub account. Then, on my terminal i did the following steps:
- Cloned the repository to my computer using git clone.
- Changed into the 'Css responsive challenge directory using cd command prompt as prefix.
- Opened the folder on explorer
- Transferred all files and folders from the 'starter' directory to the 'Css portfolio challenge' directory in file explorer. Subsequently, I launched the folder in Visual Studio Code by executing the command code.

## Deployment methods
I practiced regular commits of my work, pushing changes to my GitHub repository only when substantial modifications were implemented. I employed commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to store and upload my code.
