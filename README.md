# Css portfolio challenge.
## Introduction.
This readme serves as the documentation for my evolving portfolio page, intended to be continually updated as my course advances. The portfolio is designed to present a comprehensive overview of my skills and talents for prospective employers seeking to fill part-time or full-time positions. It aims to showcase my most impactful work and provide insight into the strategic thinking behind each project.
